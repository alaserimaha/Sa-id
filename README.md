Welcome to the GitHub repository of **Breez**, crafted by the **Fresh Sight** team for the **HPC** hackathon. **Breez** is a system capable of being linked to any camera. This system detects litter or trash discarded from vehicles onto the street, documents it as an infraction, and alerts the driver. Additionally, relevant authorities can access this data and generate reports on the level of waste on Saudi streets.


## Description

During our time with **HPC** hackathon, we worked on Breeze, a system capable of being linked to any camera. This system detects litter or trash discarded from vehicles onto the street, documents it as an infraction, and alerts the driver. Additionally, relevant authorities can access this data and generate reports on the level of waste on Saudi streets, all through "breeze".!

## Features

- **Personalized Onboarding**: Tailored to each employee’s needs and preferences, enhancing the initial onboarding experience.
- **AI-powered Guidance**: Provides detailed, interactive guidance about the company’s environment, organizational structure, and policies.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) Tours**: New employees can take a virtual tour of the company facilities to familiarize themselves with the environment before stepping into the office.
- **Skill Development**: Offers various task simulations to help employees learn the job and develop soft skills in communication, problem-solving, and leadership.
- **Performance Tracking**: Generates detailed reports for HR and managers on employee performance and progress during the onboarding phase.
- **Support for Mental Well-being**: The system supports employee mental health by offering a positive, structured, and motivational environment.


## Installation

Breez consists of two main components: the app (built with Laravel) and the API (powered by Django). Below are the steps to set up the API.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The project uses various Python packages, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
 pip install -r requirements. txt
```

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alaserimaha/Sa-id.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the API directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sa-id/django
    ```
3. Set up the Django environment:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints from your Laravel application to interact with the data processed by the Django backend.
