Welcome to the GitHub repository of **ساعِد (Sa'id)**, crafted by the Sa'id Team for the **Estronout** hackathon. 
**ساعِد (Sa'id)** is a system designed to provide a seamless and supportive onboarding journey for new employees, enhancing their productivity and well-being using emerging technologies. 
The platform aims to foster employee loyalty and sustainability within organizations by ensuring their growth and skills development.


## Description

During our time with the **Estronout** hackathon, we created **ساعِد (Sa'id)**—a comprehensive system to provide a customized onboarding experience for new employees. The system helps employees quickly adapt to their new environment, increasing their productivity and mental well-being. By integrating with HR systems and leveraging technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and AI, it creates a smooth transition, helping employees feel welcomed, empowered, and motivated. The platform also aids HR departments by streamlining employee onboarding and skill development processes.

## Features

- **Personalized Onboarding**: Tailored to each employee’s needs and preferences, enhancing the initial onboarding experience.
- **AI-powered Guidance**: Provides detailed, interactive guidance about the company’s environment, organizational structure, and policies.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) Tours**: New employees can take a virtual tour of the company facilities to familiarize themselves with the environment before stepping into the office.
- **Skill Development**: Offers various task simulations to help employees learn the job and develop soft skills in communication, problem-solving, and leadership.
- **Performance Tracking**: Generates detailed reports for HR and managers on employee performance and progress during the onboarding phase.
- **Support for Mental Well-being**: The system supports employee mental health by offering a positive, structured, and motivational environment.


## Installation

Sa'id consists of two main components: the app (built with Laravel) and the API (powered by Django). Below are the steps to set up the API.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The project uses various Python packages, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
 pip install -r requirements. txt
```

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alaserimaha/Sa-id.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the API directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sa-id/django
    ```
3. Set up the Django environment:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints from your Laravel application to interact with the data processed by the Django backend.
